__Machine Learning__

    -> Deep Learning and Machine Learning Text Recognition

        - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

        - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

        - Natural Language Processing (NLP)


__AI__
    
    -> Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
        - requires text localization and character segmentation

__Linear Regression__
